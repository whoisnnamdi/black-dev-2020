To clone this repo, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/whoisnnamdi/black-dev-2020.git
```

To run this code you'll need the packages `rpy2` and `statsmodels`. To install these via `pip`, run:

```bash
pip install rpy2
pip install statsmodels
```

In addition, due to relying on both Python and R for the `rpy2` module, you will need both languages installed on your computer.
