Open and run the appropriately titled notebooks to replicate the analysis and generate the charts shown in the presentation.


To run this code you'll need the packages `rpy2`, `statsmodels`, and `altair`. To install these via `pip`, run:

```bash
pip install rpy2
pip install statsmodels
pip install altair
```

In addition, due to relying on both Python and R for the `rpy2` module, you will need both languages installed on your computer.
